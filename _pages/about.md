I am a PhD student in economics at Yale University. I began my program in Fall 2021. My research interests are in health care, industrial organization, and econometrics.

Previously, I worked in San Francisco (pictured above!) as part of the economics team at Lyft. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2019 with degrees in economics and math.
