I am a PhD student in economics at Yale University. I began my program in 2021. My primary research interests are industrial organization, insurance design, and health care.

Previously, I worked in San Francisco (pictured above!) as part of the economics team at Lyft. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2019 with degrees in economics and math.
