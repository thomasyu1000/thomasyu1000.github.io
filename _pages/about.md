I am a PhD candidate in economics at Yale University. I began my PhD program in Fall 2021. My research is in health economics and industrial organization. I apply microeconomic theory and econometric methods to evaluate public policies with the goals of making health care markets more effective, equitable, and efficient. My current projects are related to hospital obstetric units, the medical resident labor market, and Medicare drug prices.

Previously, I worked as part of the economics team at Lyft. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Chicago.
