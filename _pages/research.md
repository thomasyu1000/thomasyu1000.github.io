## Undergraduate Honors Thesis

- **A Model of Countercyclical Macroprudential Policy**
	<br>[[Paper](/assets/docs/YuThomas_HonorsThesis.pdf){:target="_blank"}, [Code](https://github.com/thomasyu1000/yu2019_thesis/){:target="_blank"}]

	Since the adoption of Basel III bank regulations, countercyclical capital requirements have risen in
	prominence as a macroprudential tool for mitigating systemic risk and promoting financial stability.
	In this paper, I develop a model with a social cost of debt, which is addressed by imposing a capital
	requirement on financial intermediaries that responds countercyclically to aggregate debt and output.
	I evaluate the economy’s responses to simulated financial crises and find that a countercyclical capital
	requirement reduces the volatility of macroeconomic variables, helping the economy recover after a shock.
	This smoothing effect can be explained by the degree of the requirement’s countercyclicality. In a welfare
	analysis, I find that a countercyclical capital requirement can lead to greater welfare gains than a debt
	tax. These results provide strong evidence in favor of the use of countercyclical capital requirements as
	a policy instrument.
